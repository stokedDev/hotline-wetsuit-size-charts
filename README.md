Accessible HTML5 tables for Hotline wetsuit sizing

I coded these tables for a gig at Hotline Hotsuits.

Current tables on their website are images which means that they aren't accessible for people with cognitive or visual disabilities nor good for SEO.

I didn't create their website and am not responsible for this mistake in any way.

I saw a problem, offered to solve it, received offer, but lack of coordination between Hotline and their web dev team has delayed this code from being integrated as of now.

This was my first professional coding experience.
