Accessible HTML5 tables for Hotline wetsuit sizing

I coded these tables for a gig at Hotline Hotsuits.

The purpose of this repository is to replace tables on their website that are images which means that they aren't accessible for people with cognitive or visual disabilities nor good for SEO.

This was my first professional coding experience.
